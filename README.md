## Welcome to JSChannel

JSChannel is a small JavaScript abstraction layer on top of HTML5
cross document messaging.  It builds rich messaging
semantics out of postMessage.

## Overview

HTML5's cross document messaging opens up a ton of possibilities for
interesting client side creations.  But, the specification only
provides the bare minimum amount of plumbing required to support cross
domain client side communication.  JSChannel is a very small
abstraction that provides higher level messaging semantics on top of
postMessage, which include:

  * Query/Response - including support for *callback arguments*
  * Notifications - Fire and forget style.

In addition to support for these messaging semantics, the library sports
the following additional features:

  * "scoping", all messages will be safely tucked under the namespace you
    provide.
  * multiple channel support - message handling properly stops propagation
    once messages are handled, and when they're not it leaves
    them alone.  This means you can have an arbitrary number of different
    channels in a single page.
  * Rich messaging semantics - Query/Response and Notifications
  * An idiomatic api - exceptions inside message handlers automatically
    turn into error responses.  return values are likewise converted into
    "success" responses.
  * support for errors: the library provides the basic structure for error
    propagation while the client define error codes.
  * very compatible with asynchronicity.
  * supports any browser with JSON parsing (native or as a JS library) and
    postMessage.
  * designed primarily for inter-frame communication.

## Sample usage

The simplest possible use case.  A client (parent.html) loads up another
document in an iframe (child.html) and invokes a function on her.

### parent.html

```html
<html>
<head><script src="src/jschannel.js"></script></head>
<body>
<iframe id="childId" src="child.html"></iframe>
</body>
<script>

var chan = Channel.build({
    window: document.getElementById("childId").contentWindow,
    origin: "*",
    scope: "testScope"
});
chan.call({
    method: "reverse",
    params: "hello world!",
    success: function(v) {
        console.log(v);
    }
});

</script>
</html>
```

### child.html

```html
<html><head>
<script src="src/jschannel.js"></script>
<script>

var chan = Channel.build({window: window.parent, origin: "*", scope: "testScope"});
chan.bind("reverse", function(trans, s) {
    return s.split("").reverse().join("");
});

</script>
</head>
</html>
```

## Influences

[JSON-RPC](http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-2-0)
provided some design inspiration for message formats.

The existence of [pmrpc](http://code.google.com/p/pmrpc/) inspired me there's
room for pure js abstractions in this area.

The API design was influenced by
[postmessage](http://github.com/daepark/postmessage).
